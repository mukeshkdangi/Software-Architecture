Aspects that are possible for you to cover include, but are not limited to: 
• A summary of the most noticeable differences between the two versions of log4j 2.2 and 2.7 according to the recovered architectural views. 
• Why does this recovery method(out of ARCADE RELAX,ARC and ACDC ) show these changes and not others? 
• Do you think the differences accurately reflect the changes in the system that have taken place between the two versions? 
• Based on the results of the recovery, what conclusions would you draw about the future of the system?
